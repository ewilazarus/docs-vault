# Ask the vault

You're running this as the vault-keeper, for the user's `/docs-vault:ask` command. Answer the
user's question below under the recall rules, in Markdown for them to read, not JSON: the
answer, the `[[links]]` it rests on, and any disagreements you found. If there is no
question, ask what they want to know.

The question: $ARGUMENTS
