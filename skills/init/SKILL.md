description: Bootstrap a project's docs/ folder as an Obsidian vault for the recall and record skills. It sets up the journal and the decisions folder, writes the project's Conventions.md with the user, adds a docs-vault section to the project's CLAUDE.md, and offers the plugins to everyone on the project through its settings. Run once per project, when the user asks to set up, initialise or bootstrap the docs vault.

# Bootstrap the docs vault

This sets up a project so the `recall` and `record` skills can operate it. docs-vault owns
only two folders: `Journal/`, the daily record of what meaningful things happened and what
was left open, and `Decisions/`, one note per important choice and its reason. Everything
else is defined by the `Conventions.md` you write here, together with the user.

**Never overwrite or move an existing file.** Where something already exists, adopt it,
report it, and move on. The one exception is the marked docs-vault section in `CLAUDE.md`,
which this skill owns and may replace. Do the steps in order.

A bundled script makes every mechanical change: the project's settings, the folders, the
Daily notes setting, the `CLAUDE.md` section and `.gitignore`. It only adds what is
missing, keeps any value that is already set differently and says so, and changes nothing
on a second run. Don't make those edits by hand.

```bash
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/init.sh plan  [--agents-md import|append] [--ignore-plugins]
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/init.sh apply [--agents-md import|append] [--ignore-plugins]
```

Run it from the project root.

## 1. Survey what exists

```bash
ls -la docs/ docs/.obsidian docs/Journal docs/Decisions 2>&1 | head -40
test -f docs/Conventions.md && sed -n '1,40p' docs/Conventions.md
fd . docs -t d -d 2 -E .obsidian 2>/dev/null || find docs -maxdepth 2 -type d -not -path '*/.obsidian*'
git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree 2>/dev/null || echo "not a git repo"
pgrep -xq Obsidian && echo "Obsidian is running"
${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/init.sh plan
```

If `docs/` already holds notes, the conventions describe *those notes as they are*. Don't
propose restructuring them here. That is a separate job, and only if the user asks.

## 2. Show the plan and settle its choices

Show the user the plan's output, and explain each part in plain words:

- **`.claude/settings.json`** offers both plugins to everyone who opens the project.
  `docs-vault` depends on kepano's `obsidian` plugin, and Claude Code only installs a
  dependency from a marketplace already added, so both marketplaces are declared. Plugins
  load at session start, so others get them in their next session. A `kept` line is a
  plugin someone set on purpose, such as one disabled for this project. Leave it that way
  unless the user says otherwise.
- **`docs/Journal/` and `docs/Decisions/`.** Don't create a folder for todos or tasks.
  Open work is a plain checkbox under a `## Follow-ups` heading in the journal day where it
  came up, and `/docs-vault:todos` lists it from there.
- **`daily-notes.json`** appears only when the Daily notes core plugin is on. It points new
  daily notes at the journal. If the plan says it `kept` another folder, ask whether to
  change it, and if so edit that one key yourself.
- **The `CLAUDE.md` section,** from this skill's `assets/CLAUDE-section.md`. Hooks only fire
  when Claude touches `docs/`, and skills only load when a request matches them. This
  section covers what neither catches: work that changes something the vault documents
  without ever opening `docs/`. It names the skills and nothing else. **Don't add the
  skills' rules or the project's conventions to it.** They live in the skills and in
  `docs/Conventions.md`, and a copy here would go stale while loading into every session.
- **`.gitignore`** keeps each user's own Obsidian settings out of git: their open panes,
  the graph view's settings, their editor preferences such as the default view mode, and
  their theme and fonts. Obsidian rewrites these whenever someone clicks around, zooms the
  graph or changes a preference, so they'd churn on every commit, and they aren't the
  project's to set. Graph colours stay per-user as a result, and `/docs-vault:graph` sets
  them for whoever runs it. Say what the lines hold rather than just naming "Obsidian
  files": a user who doesn't know what's in `.obsidian/` can't judge them.

Two choices change the plan. Ask them together:

- **`CLAUDE.md: needs a choice`** means the project has `AGENTS.md` and no `CLAUDE.md`.
  Creating a `CLAUDE.md` makes Claude Code stop reading `AGENTS.md` on its own, so either
  create one that imports it (`--agents-md import`) or add the section to `AGENTS.md`
  (`--agents-md append`). Recommend `import`, because the section names Claude Code
  commands that other agents reading `AGENTS.md` can't use.
- **`note: the vault has community plugins`**: their code and the list of enabled plugins
  are usually personal installs, so offer `--ignore-plugins`. Leave it off if the project
  shares its plugins, and say so in `Conventions.md`.

## 3. Apply

Run `init.sh apply` with the flags chosen in step 2, and show its output.

**Obsidian reads `.obsidian/*.json` only at startup, and writes its in-memory settings
back when they change.** If Daily notes was changed and Obsidian is running, the change won't
show until it reloads, and it can be lost if the user changes a setting in the meantime.
Offer to reload it. With the user's OK, run
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/../recall/scripts/obsidian.sh reload`. It reloads only after checking
that the CLI targets this vault, and says what to do if it didn't. A vault Obsidian hasn't
opened yet has nothing to reload: step 6 tells the user to open it.

## 4. Write `Conventions.md` with the user

Start from this skill's `assets/Conventions.md`, and fill it in from what the survey found
and what the user tells you. Create it with the Write tool, which refuses to replace a file
you haven't read. Ask about the things you can't infer, and ask them together, not one by
one:

- **Layout:** which folders exist or should exist, and what each one holds. `Journal/`
  and `Decisions/` belong to docs-vault, so don't define them again. Don't add another
  home for decisions or open work either, such as an ADR folder, a todo list or question
  notes. The skills only look in `Decisions/` and in the journal's Follow-ups.
- **Notes:** how notes are named, which frontmatter they carry, and whether there are
  templates. If there are, record the folder they live in. If the user has no preference
  on frontmatter, offer a single `description:` line. The journal's day files, the
  decisions and `Conventions.md` already carry one, so `rg '^description:' docs/` indexes
  the whole vault.
- **Tags and callouts:** any the project uses, and where they go. docs-vault itself uses
  none, because its headings and folders carry the meaning.
- **Rules:** anything that binds work on this project. Examples are what needs
  confirming first, what must never be done, and how to reach the systems the vault
  documents.

Leave a section out if the user has no answer for it yet. An empty heading is not
a convention. Keep each rule an instruction, followed by its reason. **Don't restate
the journal, decision or follow-up rules from `record` here.** A copy is one more place
that goes stale.

If `docs/Conventions.md` already exists, don't rewrite it. Offer only the additions the
survey turned up.

## 5. Record the setup

Load `/docs-vault:record`, then write today's journal the way it describes. Keep it short:
a `## Summary` with a bullet or two on what was set up, not one per answer the user gave.
Write a decision note only for a choice from step 4 whose reason will matter later, such
as a layout rule the project commits to, and link it under `## Decisions`. Put anything
left for later, such as conventions the user wants to settle once the project grows,
under `## Follow-ups` as plain checkboxes.

## 6. Hand over

Tell the user to open `docs/` as a vault in Obsidian (Open folder as vault), and that
`recall` and `record` take over from here. If the layout has more than one folder, mention that `/docs-vault:graph` colour-codes the graph view by folder. If `~/.config/docs-vault/presets/` holds saved presets, offer `/docs-vault:preset` to apply one, so the new vault gets the user's usual Obsidian settings. Summarise what was created, what was already there, and
what was skipped.
